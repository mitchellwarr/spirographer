# Spirograph Toy

This is inspired from the work done here https://github.com/sokolov-teach/spirograph
And from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-e9C8g5x68

### Get started

This repo uses yarn. After installing all node_modules, you can start the server or build the dist folder directly.

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

This uses port 3000 by default
